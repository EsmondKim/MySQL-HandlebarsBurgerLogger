The app requires installation of express, express-handlebars and MySql to operate.  

## Usage

To use the application type in hamburgers that you'd like to eat into the form and hit the submit button.  You'll see this new item appears on the list of "Burgers for you to DEVOUR," and it is also saved in the MySQL database in the backend. When you hit the "Devour" button next to a burger, it dissapers from the list and moves to the "Burgers That You Have Devoured!" list.
